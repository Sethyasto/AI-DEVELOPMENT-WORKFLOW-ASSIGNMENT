AI Development Workflow Assignment
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the AI Development Workflow Assignment, as part of the PLP Academy curriculum. The assignment focuses on applying the AI Development Workflow to a real-world problem, specifically predicting patient readmission risk in a hospital setting. It includes a LaTeX document addressing the assignment requirements and a workflow diagram.
Repository Structure

AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment.pdf: The main LaTeX document (compiled as a PDF) containing responses to all parts of the assignment, including short answer questions, a case study, critical thinking, and a workflow diagram.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the assignment.

Assignment Details
The assignment is divided into four parts:

Short Answer Questions: Covers problem definition, data collection, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment for a hypothetical AI problem (predicting student dropout rates).
Case Study Application: Applies the AI workflow to predict patient readmission risk within 30 days, including data strategy, model development, deployment, and optimization.
Critical Thinking: Discusses ethical concerns, bias mitigation, and trade-offs in model interpretability vs. accuracy.
Reflection & Workflow Diagram: Reflects on challenges and includes a flowchart of the AI Development Workflow.

How to Use

View the PDF: Open AI_Development_Workflow_Assignment.pdf to review the complete assignment submission, including the workflow diagram created using TikZ in LaTeX.
Compile LaTeX (Optional): If modifications are needed, compile the LaTeX source code (included in the PDF artifact) using a LaTeX editor with pdflatex and the latexmk tool. Ensure the following packages are installed:
geometry
amsmath
graphicx
hyperref
parskip
xcolor
enumitem
tikz


Dependencies: The LaTeX document uses standard packages from texlive-full and texlive-fonts-extra. No additional code files (e.g., Python scripts) are included, as the assignment focuses on theoretical and documented analysis.

Ethical Considerations

Patient Privacy: The case study emphasizes HIPAA compliance through data encryption and access controls.
Bias Mitigation: Strategies like stratified sampling are proposed to address biases in healthcare data.
Interpretability: The trade-off between model accuracy and interpretability is discussed, with solutions like SHAP values for explainability.

Submission Notes

The PDF has been shared as an article in the PLP Academy Community, per the assignment guidelines.
The document adheres to the 5â€“10 page limit (excluding diagrams) and includes references to the CRISP-DM framework and HIPAA guidelines.
The repository is designed for clarity and ease of review, with all content centralized in the PDF.
